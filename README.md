# Smithy for VS Code

This package is a Visual Studio Code extension to recognize and highlight the
Smithy interface definition language (IDL). It can also be used as a TextMate
bundle in TextMate and [IntelliJ using a third-party plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/importing-textmate-bundles.html).

## Features

This extension provides basic syntax highlighting of ".smithy" files.

Additionally, it provides [Snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets).

## Installation

This extension can be installed from the
[VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=smithy.smithy-vscode-extension).

To install from source, follow these steps:
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-vscode.git && cd smithy-vscode`
* Run npm commands to install:
`npm install && npm run install-plugin`

## Authoring a model
If your model requires dependencies, add a `smithy-build.json` file to the root of your project, specifying Maven dependencies, along with the
repositories where they can be located.
```
{
    "version": "1.0",
    "maven": {
        "dependencies": ["software.amazon.smithy:smithy-aws-traits:1.40.0"],
        "repositories": [{ "url": "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/" }]
    }
}
```
Start authoring your Smithy model. Opening a `*.smithy` file will activate
the extension.

## Use with any Maven private registry

Follow [these instructions](https://get-coursier.io/docs/other-credentials#property-file) to set the credentials file for your Maven private registry. Here is an example for a Maven registry provided by GitHub:
```
github.username=<ANY_USERNAME>
github.password=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>
github.host=maven.pkg.github.com
```

## Use with IntelliJ

You can use this extension for syntax highlighting in IntelliJ by installing the
"TextMate bundle support" plugin and registering this repository as a bundle.
